# Mouse Ninja: The Mouse Jiggler Reimagined

## Overview

Welcome to **Synaptic Mouse Ninja**â€”a cheeky evolution of the venerable [Mouse Jiggler](https://github.com/arkane-systems/mousejiggler) by the legendary *arkane-systems*. This isn't just a mere fork; it's a whole new beast. We've taken the core idea, given it a fresh coat of WPF, refactored the heck out of it, and tossed out the ancient User32 dependency. The result? A sleeker, more secure, and less detectable solution for your mouse-jiggling needs.

Kudos and unending praise to *arkane-systems* for the original brilliance. We stand on the shoulders of giants.

## Warning

Mouse Ninja is dark hack code for **educational purposes only**. Seriously, don't use this in an office environment unless you're really itching for a conversation with your IT department. Use responsibly!

## Features

- **WPF Magic**: Enjoy the modern, pretty interface that only WPF can provide.
- **No User32**: We've exorcised the old User32 dependency, making Mouse Ninja more secure and stealthy.
- **Same Great Functionality**: Keeps your screen awake and idle detectors at bay, just like the original.

## Installation

Getting started with Mouse Ninja is simple:

1. **Clone the Repo**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/geosynapse/synaptic-mouse-ninja.git
   ```
2. **Build the Solution**: Open the solution in Visual Studio and hit that build button.

## Usage
